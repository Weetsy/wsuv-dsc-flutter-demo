# WSUV DSC Flutter Workshop

**IMPORTANT:** Before the workshop, please install the Flutter SDK on your machine using the following tutorial: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

## Starting From Scratch

Create or navigate to a folder on your computer where you want to store the Flutter application. `cd` into your project folder and type `flutter create Name_Of_App` to get a sample project created.

If you are using an IDE for Flutter, please visit the following link to configure your IDE: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=vscode

You can use any of the editors listed, but for this workshop I will be using Visual Studio Code.

## Cloning The Completed Project

To use the completed project, you must first clone it using `git clone https://github.com/Weetsy/wsuv_dsc_flutter_demo.git` or download the zip from the github repository. To open the project in VS Code go to File -> Open Folder and select the cloned project folder.
